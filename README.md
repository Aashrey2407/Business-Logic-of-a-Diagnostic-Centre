# Business-Logic-of-a-Diagnostic-Centre
A Diagnostic centre is a key aspect of the healthcare sector which acts as a bridge between a patient and his/her
diagnosis. These centres have specialised equipment and machinery to predict and diagnose illnesses. A
diagnostic centre runs on four core values:-
Quality and Accuracy of Results
Affordability
Faster TAT(Turn Around Time)
Quality of Machinery used
We have chosen this sector as our area of focus as we believe this sector is of great consequence as seen during
incidents such as the COVID pandemic where these centres became hubs of data collection. This data was of
great significance to the country to analyse and heal the situation. Hence, we as a team believe that analysing and
improving the business logic of a diagnostic centre is of key significance to a country.
Analysis of data collected from a diagnostic centre would enable us to predict future trends of a countryâ€™s health
and what are the pain points which need to be addressed to have a bustling and healthy populace.
